#VectorEmbeddingUsingChromaDB
.ipynb file is used to set the parameters such as chunk_size,chunk_overlap and dimension since it requires experimentation. 
Since chroma db is a on disk database hence we can compare performance of
differently configured chroma db and we can choose the best configured model for our use case.
We are using Amazon Bedrock Generative AI.
Note : Some of the params are removed for security reasons.
